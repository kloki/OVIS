This directory contains the full OVIS corpus.
There are some extra files containing specific parts of the corpus for your convenience
sentences:              The input strings for the answers
updateSemantics:        The corresponding semantics for the answers
flatTreesOvis:          The corresponding semantically annotated trees
conformedTrees:         Same as above only a more conventional annotation
conformedTrees:Curly:   Because the semantics also contain parenthesis most parsers will get confused.
                        Therefore the semantical parenthesis are replaced with curly braces
