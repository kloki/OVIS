This directory contains a baseline for extracting the updatesemantics from the natural language strings.
For more information about the baseline see the report.

Rerunning the experiment should be as easy as running baseline.sh (./baseline.sh) given:
-It depends on the folder structure in the repository so this should be the same
-You have installed bitpar, you can get it here <http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/tcl/SOFTWARE/BitPar.html>
-PCFG_extractor.jar should be in this folder. You can download it here.
